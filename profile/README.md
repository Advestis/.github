## Our public packages

### Utilities

* [TransparentPath](https://github.com/Advestis/transparentpath) : A _pathlib_-like way to handle paths on Google Cloud Storage. Developed by our former Lead Python Engineer Philippe Cotte.
* [MailUtility](https://github.com/Advestis/mailutility) : Package containing a tool to send mail and a tool to monitor a mailbox easily. Supports remote directories with TransparentPath.
* [TableWriter](https://github.com/cottephi/tablewriter) : Class used to produce a ready-to-compile **.tex** file containing a table from a pandas or dask DataFrame object. Can also compile the **.tex** to produce a **.pdf**.
* [PDFFactory](https://github.com/Advestis/pdffactory) : Class to update and/or create a PDF object, and add pages to it. Supports matplotlib.figure and tablewriter.TableWriter objects.
* [HtmlMerger](https://github.com/Advestis/htmlmerger) : Package allowing to merge all HTML files in a directory in a single file.
* [Color and Style Cycler](https://github.com/Advestis/color-style-cycler) : Cycler for matplotlib. Can cycle through combination of colors and line or marker styles
* [AdRubix](https://github.com/Advestis/adrubix) : RubixHeatmap class for plotting complex, highly customizable heatmaps with metadata as HTML and PNG
* [AdParallelEngine](https://github.com/Advestis/adparallelengine) : A package wrapped around Dask, mpi4py and basic Python's multiprocessing libraries providing an easy way to make parallel maps

### Best Coding Practices

* [complex](https://github.com/Advestis/complex) : Simple package illustrating good code practices by implementing the notion of complex number. Also used as a template for creating a public Python package.
* [AdTypingDecorators](https://github.com/Advestis/adtypingdecorators) : Python decorators allowing to check and/or enforce types in functions' arguments based on typing hints
* [mail_watcher_example](https://github.com/Advestis/mail_watcher_example) : An example of mail watcher cronjob for Kubernetes

### Numerical Analysis

* [AdAdjust](https://github.com/Advestis/adadjust) : Package allowing to fit any mathematical function to (for now 1D only) data
* [AdAnnealing](https://github.com/Advestis/adannealing) : Package doing simulated annealing

### Rule-Based Algorithms

* [IFRA](https://github.com/Advestis/ifra) : Interpretable Federated Rule Algorithm
* [RIPE](https://github.com/Advestis/RIPE) (forked from [thibaulthans/RIPE](https://github.com/thibaulthans/RIPE)) : Implementation of a rule based prediction algorithm called RIPE
* [RICE](https://github.com/Advestis/RICE) : Implementation of a rule-based prediction algorithm called RICE (Rule Induction Covering Estimator). RICE is a deterministic and interpretable algorithm, for regression problem.
* [ruleskit](https://github.com/Advestis/ruleskit) : Package implementing all useful tools for rule-based machine learning algorithms

### Multivariate Analysis

* [AdNMTF](https://github.com/Advestis/adnmtf) : Non-Negative Matrix and Tensor Factorizations co-developped with our biostatistician Paul Fogel

## Under construction

* [AdClean](https://github.com/Advestis/adclean) : A package that allows one to clean features prior to a learning process

## Our published papers

* [Elsevier Energy and AI 2022](https://github.com/Advestis/els_paper) : Repository for the Elsevier Energy and AI 2022 paper "Stress Testing Electrical Grids: Generative Adversarial Networks For Load Scenario Generation"
